# Yard-companion

Yard companion is an iOS app developed during the developer week hackathon.  

### What it does
Yard Companion uses [NEC's](nec.com) detection api to track faces that come to the doorway.  If it is a unfamiliar face it will send an sms to the phone number given through the [Telesigns](telesigns.com) application.  

### Requirements and Dependencies
Swift 4
[Telesign's API](https://www.telesign.com/products/messaging-api/)
NEC's was given to us as a trial during the hackathon, and will be switching the Facial Recognition feature in the app to Apple's [Vision Library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision)
